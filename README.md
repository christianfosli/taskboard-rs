# To-Do App

A Kanban inspired to-do app for managing tasks and tracking progress.

The purpose of this application is mostly for me to play with web development
with rust, docker, kubernetes and elasticsearch.

Elasticsearch might be a weird choice to persist the to-do items.
I chose it simply to learn more about it.
